# WGUPS_parcel_delivery
This is my PA for C950 Structures and Algorithms 2 at WGU.

This project is to map out delivery routes with recorded times of delivery/departure of X number of packages for 3 trucks with only 2 drivers.
The goal is to have total miles < 140 with no more than 16 packages per truck. Some packages have specific pickup/dropoff times. In the event 
of a package modification, the algorithm is self adjusting to accommodate changes.
